# Description
This is the middleman website associated with the HelloKitty project

# Installation using *Docker*

Run the `docker-compose up` command to build the container and start the **Middleman server**
``` bash
$ docker-compose up
```

If you want just to build the container, without running the Middleman Server fire the `docker-compose build` command
``` bash
$ docker-compose build web
```
