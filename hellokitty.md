# The Hello Kitty project

__\*\*\*10 DEPLOYS/day\*\*\*__
**EAT OUR OWN DOGFOOOD**

This project aims at creating a new development factory within ANZ.

## Main current challenges

* Lack or resources in ANZ
* Off-shore capability is existing but the quality that is delivered is not at the expected level
* ...

We need to do as much with far less. Creating a near shore delivery capability will help tackle the lack of quality aspect but is not scalable.
New ways to deliver Salesforce projects or on a larger scale, cloud related project must be created. This is the goal of the Hello Kitty Initiative

## Base principles and rules of engagement

* Challenge the existing and broadly accepted delivery methods, including Agile
* *Nothing is impossible* mindset
* BDD and TDD
* Automation is your friend
* There is always a different/smarter/quicker/more efficient way to do something


## Tools that need to be built

* Salesforce Kanban (created on the Butagaz engagement, enhanced on the World Economic Forum)
    * **TODO** Explain quickly what it is
* **Story into features transformer**: Creates a link between **Cucumber** features and Salesforce stories.
    * The Cucumber Features are developed by the Business Analysts.
* **Stories status** based on the status of the Cucumber feature (Not implemented/pending/red/green)
* **Tools to monitor** how the systems are working >> Check mmonit
* **Visualisation tools** >> Check dashing
